Computable Entropy Coordinates: Encoding Thermodynamic Causality in Discrete Physics Automata 

This discrete spacetime model  establishes computable multiplicative entropy coordinates to guide automaton evolution in alignment with thermodynamic causality. By defining entropy through multiplicative accumulation, the model ensures irreversible entropy increase while remaining consistent with conventional logarithmic entropy formulations. It further incorporates path selection rules derived from the least-action principle, enabling physically realistic evolution in discrete systems. The framework demonstrates broad consistency with observed phenomena, from quantum processes to relativistic effects, offering a new computational foundation for physics-based automata. Benchmark tests reveal significantly improved thermodynamic compliance compared to traditional simulation approaches.

This model defines time as the refresh of the universe's quantum bit network, where each refresh corresponds to a moment.

### Call for Collaboration: Visualizing Entropy-Coordinated Spacetime with Manim

I invite Manim animation experts to collaborate as co-author of this model on visualizing this novel discrete spacetime framework, where thermodynamic entropy serves as the fundamental coordinate for time evolution. This model offers unique advantages for scientific visualization:

### Natural Frame-Based Representation:

The model's discrete time steps align perfectly with animation frames, with each frame progression corresponding to precisely computable entropy increments. This creates a direct mapping between thermodynamic evolution and animation timelines.

### Visually Rich Physical Processes:

The framework elegantly demonstrates:

Time-entropy correspondence (visualizing the arrow of time)

Mass-gravity duality through geometric deformations

Quantum stabilization effects with clear visual signatures
